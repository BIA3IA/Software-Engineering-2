\section{Tested Project}
\label{sec:tested_project}

The analyzed project is the \textbf{Best Bike Paths (BBP)} System, a web-based crowdsourcing 
application aimed at supporting cyclists in discovering safer and more comfortable routes,
developed by \href{https://github.com/Huangsj1/HuangLiMa}{\textbf{Huang Shijie, Li Yuqing, and Ma Zeyao} (github.com)}.


The delivered material includes both the frontend and backend components of the system,
as well as a deployable JAR package for the backend.
