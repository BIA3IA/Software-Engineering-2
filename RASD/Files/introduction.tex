% --------------------------------------------------------------------------
In recent years, cycling has become an increasingly popular and sustainable means of transportation. However, cyclists often face difficulties in finding safe routes and reliable information about bike paths' conditions.  
The \textbf{Best Bike Paths (BBP)} system aims to address this issue by offering a platform where users can record their rides, explore optimal routes, and contribute with updated information about cycling paths and obstacles.

\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}

The purpose of this document is to define, analyze, and specify the requirements of the \textbf{Best Bike Paths (BBP)} system in a precise and complete manner.  
It establishes a shared understanding of the system’s goals, requirements, and boundaries, describing both the functional behavior and the assumptions about the real-world environment in which the system operates.  
This document serves as a common reference for all project stakeholders, ensuring a clear and shared understanding of what the system must accomplish and under which constraints.

\subsection{Goals}
\label{subsec:goals}

The following \textbf{goals} outline the desired properties of the real world that the Best Bike Paths (BBP) system is intended to achieve.
They reflect the stakeholders’ expectations about how cycling activities and information should be managed and shared, independently of any technical or implementation detail.

\begin{itemize}    
    \item[\textbf{[G1]}] \textbf{Users can access accurate and up-to-date information about bike paths}, including their status and possible obstacles, to support safe and informed cycling.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}

\textbf{Best Bike Paths (BBP)} is a software system designed to support users in \textbf{creating}, \textbf{exploring}, and \textbf{sharing} information about bike paths and cycling activities.
Users can \textbf{register} on the platform and (optional, if we want to provide personalized statistics for each user) supply personal data to track their physical condition, enabling them to start recording and monitoring their future cycling activities.

Logged-in users have access to a personal history of their trips and can view general \textbf{statistics} accumulated over time, as well as detailed \textbf{information} about each specific \textbf{trip}, such as the total distance covered, average speed, and other performance metrics.
When available, \textbf{additional information} such as weather conditions, temperature, and wind speed can be \textbf{enriched} through \textbf{external services}, provided the logged-in user owns a compatible device capable of capturing such data.
Furthermore, logged-in users can contribute to the community by \textbf{publishing} information about bike paths, \textbf{reporting} their current \textbf{status} and the presence of obstacles, to help other users identify the best and safest routes.
These data can be entered \textbf{manually}, by specifying details such as the streets composing the path and their condition, or \textbf{automatically}, through the acquisition of data from the user’s mobile device (e.g., GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope sensors).
In automated mode, BBP can infer that a user is biking based on their speed, collect GPS information to reconstruct the followed path, and detect irregular movements that may suggest the presence of potholes or surface issues. 
Since this process may generate false positives, logged-in users will have to confirm or correct the automatically acquired data before publication.

The condition of a bike path can assume several states, such as “optimal,” “medium,” “sufficient,” “requires maintenance,” or “closed.”
BBP \textbf{aggregates} and \textbf{merges} publishable information about paths obtained from multiple users, taking into account the \textbf{freshness} of the data and the number of consistent confirmations received. For instance, if a path receives multiple reports within a similar timeframe, BBP determines its status based on the most supported and up-to-date information.

Any user can search for and visualize optimal bike paths between two points on a map.
Paths are \textbf{ranked} according to their status and overall effectiveness in connecting the selected origin and destination.
While following a route, the user can visualize their position on the map. Additionally, the system may provide \textbf{notifications} about obstacles or particular conditions along the path.


\subsection{World phenomena}
\label{subsec:world_phenomena}
The phenomena relevant to the system can be grouped into two main categories.
This section focuses on non-shared world phenomena, that is, phenomena occurring in the external environment which are beyond the machine’s direct control.
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{[W1]}] - Availability and accuracy of external services (e.g., weather data providers, map services).
    \item [\textbf{[W2]}] - The user has an external device to measure additional statistics.
    \item [\textbf{[W3]}] - The user decides whether to register or report a bike path condition.
    \item [\textbf{[W4]}] - The road's physical condition can evolve.
    \item [\textbf{[W5]}] - The user may deviate from the suggested path.
    \item [\textbf{[W6]}] - The user may experience unexpected events during the ride (e.g., accidents, weather changes).
    \item [\textbf{[W7]}] - The user may choose to stop recording the trip at any time.
    \item [\textbf{[W8]}] - The user starts or finishes a path.
    \item [\textbf{[W9]}] - The user rides a bike.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definitions}
\label{subsec:definitions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bike Path:} A route, defined by collected data, where a proper bike track exists or where road conditions are generally compatible with cycling safety and speed. Path quality is determined by its aggregated status.
    \item \textbf{Path Status:} The overall condition of a Bike Path or Path Segment, as determined by the system’s aggregation and merging process. Statuses include Optimal, Medium, Sufficient, and Requires Maintenance.
    \item \textbf{Path Score:} The final numerical ranking value computed by the system, based on the path's aggregated status and effectiveness, used to prioritize and recommend path alternatives.
    \item \textbf{Report:} A submission of path information by a Registered User. A report contains details on path status and obstacles and can be either Manually Entered (user-entered) or Automatically Acquired (sensor-acquired).
    \item \textbf{Freshness:} A metric used in the path merging algorithm that measures the recency of a Path Report's submission. Older reports carry less weight in the aggregation.
