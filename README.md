# Best Bike Paths – Software Engineering 2 Project
**Best Bike Paths (BBP)** is a system designed to improve the cycling experience by collecting, merging, and displaying information about bicycle paths.  
The application enables users to:
- **Record and analyze trips**, storing statistics such as distance, speed, and duration.
- **Report road conditions** (manual mode) and **automatically detect obstacles** using simulated sensor data (auto mode).
- **Validate and merge path information** from multiple users to ensure reliable and up-to-date reports.
- **Visualize optimal routes** between two points based on quality, safety, and path conditions.
