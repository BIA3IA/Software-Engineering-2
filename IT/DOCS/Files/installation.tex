Is running on a Personal Server managed via Docker.
If you want to run it locally, you need to have PostgreSQL installed and running.
Then, clone the repository, install the dependencies with npm install, set up the .env file with the necessary environment variables, and run the migrations with Prisma.

\section{Frontend Setup}
\label{sec:frontend_setup}

You can build the app, run it on a simulator or physical device using Expo CLI.
You can install the apk on Android devices directly.

If you want to use a local server you should change the API URL in the .env file and build it or run it on the emulator,
since the built app points to the production server.
