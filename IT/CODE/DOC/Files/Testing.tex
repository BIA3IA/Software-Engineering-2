\section{Testing}
\label{testing}
In this section we will briefly describe how we tested the application, following the general guidelines given in the Design Document.
We decided to test only the backend and mobile app deployable, because the front-end can be easily tested "by seeing it working".
\subsection{Backend}

\subsubsection*{Integration Tests}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{UserController:} we tested the Sign Up and login methods, as defined in the DD. In the sign up tests, we tried with both a Customer and a Store Manager profiles. Finally, we tested the correct exchange of the Json Web Token between the parties.
    
\end{itemize}

The above test, which were in total (number), were run all together, obtaining a percentage of success of 100\%.

Thanks to the obtained result it is therefore possible to state that the backend is sturdy and built on solid source code.

\subsubsection*{Unit Tests}
We wrote unit tests for the main services of the backend, in order to verify that each method was working as expected.\\

\subsection{Mobile Application}
