# Radom Notes

## 1. Runtime & Language

### Node.js + TypeScript
- High consistency with the mobile app, which is also written in TypeScript.
- Fast learning curve for the whole team.
- Excellent ecosystem for REST APIs.
- Non‑blocking I/O, ideal for applications with frequent network communication.
- Works extremely well with modern backend frameworks (NestJS).

## 2. Backend Framework

### NestJS
- Built with TypeScript in mind.
- Enforces a clean modular architecture: modules, controllers, services.
- Built‑in dependency injection.
- Integrated request validation, pipes, guards, interceptors.
- Swagger documentation support out of the box.
- Structure highly appreciated in academic/enterprise contexts.


### Express.js
- Extremely lightweight.
- Simple and flexible.
- No structure by default.
- Requires manual setup of validation, routing organization, error handling, etc.

### Fastify
- Very fast.
- Modern and modular.
- Smaller ecosystem compared to NestJS.

## 3. Database

### PostgreSQL

- Relational model matches BBP’s entities perfectly (Users, Trips, Paths, Reports…).
- Widely adopted, stable, and easy to manage.
- Supports advanced GIS features via PostGIS, useful for future geo‑routing.
- Great compatibility with Prisma ORM.

### MySQL / MariaDB
- Stable, well‑known relational DBs.
- PostgreSQL generally offers more advanced features.

### MongoDB
- Good for flexible, schema‑less data.
- BBP uses structured, relational data; forcing MongoDB would add complexity.

## 4. ORM / Database Toolkit

### Prisma
- Strong integration with TypeScript.
- Generates fully typed queries -> fewer errors.
- Simple and clear schema file.
- Migration system included.
- Great developer experience.

### TypeORM
- Popular with NestJS.
- More complex internals, sometimes fragile migrations.

### Sequelize
- Used for years in many projects.
- TypeScript support is less clean.
- Harder to maintain in large codebases.

## 5. Authentication

### JWT (Access + Refresh Tokens)
- Standard solution for mobile apps.
- Stateless -> no server‑side session storage.
- Easy to refresh tokens securely.
- Works perfectly with HTTPS.

## 6. API Style & Documentation

### REST API + Swagger
- Simple and predictable.
- Easy to test and reason about.
- Fully sufficient given BBP’s requirements.
- Easy for teammates to test endpoints.
- Clear documentation for ITD.
- Auto-generated by NestJS.

## 8. Deployment

### Dockerized Deployment + VPS
- Docker ensures consistent environment across developers.
- Easy to ship as containers: `api`, `postgres`.
- Deployment platforms handle builds automatically.
